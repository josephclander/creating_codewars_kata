# Creating Codewars Kata

Why keep trying to actively earn honor points when you can create a **_Kata_** and earn them **passively**?

## Proposal

I have created my first kata and am in the process of building out the tests for it. The first basic test and structure is there but I stopped and thought...

> "Why stop at passive points when you should think about scaling and share the wealth?"

So my proposal is to offer a framework and group support for creating your own kata. On the [Learning Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_pyramid) teaching others is a great way to further embed your understanding. My aim is to make a repo here where you can get involved at any level regardless of time or ability.

## How to get involved

- Add new ideas or comments to the `Ideas.md` file.
  - This can be as little or as much as you want.
  - Simply add a concept or comment in some code ideas.
- Start writing your own kata description.
  - Start a `README.md` file (example: `will_i_pass`)
- Start the method file to solve it. No need to finish!
- Raise an `issue` if you spot one as constructively as possible.
- Raise an `issue` and offer a refactor via `pull request`.
- Anything else that you think of?!

üí™ This will force us to get used to **GitHub** in a more meaningful way and with any luck you'll be able to submit your own kata at some point with a little help from your friends.

ü§ù I can also learn how to `accept a pull request`, and if you do, add people as `contributers` and get us some of those [GitHub achievement badges](https://github.blog/2022-06-09-introducing-achievements-recognizing-the-many-stages-of-a-developers-coding-journey/).
